;;; Commentary:
;;
;; dad-joke.el is a terrible bit of elisp code inspired by seeing
;; https://goo.gl/NXTJXk and also with https://goo.gl/ji4Viv in mind. With
;; "thanks" to Sue for being responsible for pointing me at the former, and
;; thus reminding me of the latter.

;;; Code:

(require 'url-vars)

(defconst dad-joke-server-url "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"
  "URL for the dad joke server.")

(defconst dad-joke-user-agent "dad-joke.el (https://github.com/davep/dad-joke.el)"
  "User agent to send to the dad joke server.")

(defun dad-joke-get ()
  "Acquire a dad joke from the dad joke server."
  (let* ((url-mime-accept-string "text/plain")
         (url-request-extra-headers `(("User-Agent" . ,dad-joke-user-agent)))
         (url-show-status nil))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (url-insert-file-contents dad-joke-server-url)
      (buffer-string))))
